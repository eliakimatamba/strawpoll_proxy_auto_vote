You are ready to roll


In case you happen to be having your proxies in ```txt`` file formats, you can easy merge all your
files in a single ```xml``` file by compiling 
```\[ g++ -o txt2xml txt2xml.cpp\]```
 the ```cpp``` source file attached or running the ```txt2xml``` file and parsing your ```txt``` as a commandline ```param```.
e.g
```
./txt2xml some_proxy.txt
```
